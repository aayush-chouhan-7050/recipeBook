                        In a bowl, mix fish pieces with ginger-garlic paste, soy sauce, red chili sauce, black pepper powder, and salt.

                        In another bowl, mix all-purpose flour, cornflour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt.
                        Add water gradually to make a thick batter, ensuring there are no lumps.
                        Dip the marinated fish pieces in the batter, ensuring they are well-coated.
                        Fry the Fish:
                        
                        Heat oil in a pan for deep frying.
                        Fry the fish pieces until they turn golden brown and crisp.
                        Remove and place them on absorbent paper to drain excess oil.

                        Add sliced onions, bell peppers, and green chilies. Stir-fry until they are slightly tender but still have a crunch.
                        Make the Sauce:
                        
                        Add soy sauce, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
                        Pour in 1 cup of water and let the sauce simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.

                        Salt to taste"
                        data-recipe=
                        "Marinate the Fish:

                        In a bowl, combine the fish pieces with turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for about 30 minutes.
                        Prepare Masala Paste:
                        
                        Grind the grated coconut, chopped onion, tomatoes, green chilies, tamarind paste, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, dry red chilies, garlic, and ginger into a smooth paste. Add a little water if needed.
                        Cook the Masala:
                        
                        Heat oil in a pan. Add the ground masala paste, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder.
                        Cook the masala on medium heat, stirring constantly, until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.
                        Add Water:
                        
                        Add water to achieve the desired consistency for the curry. Bring it to a boil.
                        Add Fish:
                        
                        Gently add the marinated fish pieces to the boiling curry. Be careful not to break the fish.
                        Simmer:
                        
                        Reduce the heat to low and let the curry simmer until the fish is cooked through. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.
                        Adjust Seasoning:
                        
                        Taste the curry and adjust salt and spice levels as needed. If it's too tangy, you can balance it with a bit of sugar.
                        Finish with Coriander:
                        
                        Add chopped fresh coriander leaves and simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes.
                        Serve Hot:
                        
                        Serve the Goan Fish Curry hot with steamed rice or traditional Goan bread like poi or pav.">

                            "Prepare Vegetables:

                            Clean, peel, and chop all the vegetables as mentioned in the ingredients list.
                            Prepare Undhiyu Mix:
                            
                            In a large mixing bowl, combine surti papdi, eggplants, potatoes, sweet potatoes, purple yam, raw banana, tuvar beans, green beans, grated coconut, sesame seeds, groundnuts, ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander-cumin powder, salt, and oil. Mix everything well.
                            Stuff Eggplants:
                            
                            Stuff the slit eggplants with a portion of the prepared mix.
                            Assemble:
                            
                            Place the mixed vegetables in a heavy-bottomed pan or a traditional undhiyu matla (clay pot).
                            Cooking:
                            
                            Cook the undhiyu mix on a low flame, stirring occasionally. Add a little water if needed to prevent sticking. Cook until the vegetables are tender.
                            Prepare Tempering:
                            
                            In a separate small pan, heat oil for tempering. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and asafoetida. Allow them to splutter.
                            Add Tempering:
                            
                            Pour the tempering over the cooked undhiyu and mix well.
                            Garnish:
                            
                            Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                            Serve:
                            
                            Serve hot Undhiyu with puris or rotis.">

                    1 liter full-fat milk
                    1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
                    1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
                    A handful of chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews), for garnish
                    A pinch of saffron strands (optional)"
                        data-recipe=
                        "Boil the Milk:

                        In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat. Stir continuously to avoid the milk sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                        Simmer and Reduce:

                        Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Keep stirring occasionally to prevent the milk from forming a skin.
                        Collect Malai:

                        As the milk simmers, you will notice a layer of malai (cream) forming on the surface. Gently collect this malai and push it to the sides of the pan. Continue simmering and collecting the malai.
                        Add Sugar:

                        After the milk has reduced to about half, add sugar to it. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.
                        Continue Simmering:

                        Continue simmering and stirring until the rabri reaches a thick and creamy consistency. This process can take some time, and the volume of the milk will significantly reduce.
                        Add Cardamom and Saffron:

                        Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the rabri. Stir well to incorporate the flavors.
                        Garnish:

                        Once the rabri has thickened to your desired consistency, turn off the heat. Garnish with chopped nuts.
                        Serve:

                        Rabri can be served warm or chilled. If serving chilled, refrigerate it for a few hours before serving.
                        Optional Step (Layered Rabri):

                        For a traditional layered rabri, you can pour a layer of reduced milk into a serving dish, add a layer of sugar, nuts, and cardamom powder, and repeat the process until you achieve the desired layers.">

                        Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer, stirring occasionally.
                        Add sugar and cardamom powder. Continue simmering until the milk thickens to a rabri consistency.
                        Add Nuts:
                        
                        Add chopped nuts to the thickened milk. Stir well and turn off the heat.

                        Soak Bread in Sugar Syrup:
                        
                        Dip the fried bread slices into the cooled sugar syrup for a few seconds. Ensure both sides are well-coated but not too soggy.

                            "Prepare Rajma:

                            Cook the rajma until they are soft. Drain any excess water and mash them well.
                            Mix Ingredients:
                            
                            In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed rajma, mashed potatoes, chopped onion, besan, coriander leaves, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and salt.
                            Knead into a Dough:
                            
                            Mix all the ingredients well and knead the mixture into a smooth dough-like consistency. Ensure that the mixture is well combined.
                            Rest the Dough:
                            
                            Cover the mixture and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours. This helps the flavors to meld and the mixture to firm up.
                            Shape into Kebabs:
                            
                            After the resting period, take the mixture out and divide it into equal portions. Shape each portion into flat, round kebabs.
                            Shallow Fry:
                            
                            Heat oil or ghee in a pan for shallow frying.
                            Place the kebabs in the hot oil and cook until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides.
                            Grill (Optional):
                            
                            If you prefer, you can also grill the kebabs on skewers. Brush the kebabs with oil and grill until they are cooked through.
                            Serve Hot:
                            
                            Arrange the Rajma Galouti Kebabs on a serving platter.
                            Serve them hot with mint chutney, yogurt, or your favorite dipping sauce.">

                            Allow the batter to ferment for at least 4-6 hours or overnight. The batter should have a thick pouring consistency after fermentation.

                            If using skewers, thread marinated paneer cubes, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes onto skewers, alternating them.
                            Grill or Bake:
                            
                            Grill or bake the skewers until the paneer is charred and cooked through. Baste with oil occasionally to keep them moist.
                            If using an oven, you can place the skewers on a baking sheet and bake at 200°C (400°F) for about 15-20 minutes or until done.
                            Sprinkle Tandoori Masala:

                            Heat oil in a pan and sauté the marinated chicken until it is partially cooked. Set aside.
                            Cooking Rice:
                            Boil soaked basmati rice with bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set aside.
                            Biryani Masala:
                            In a large pan or pot, heat oil or ghee. Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Sauté until the spices release their aroma.

                            Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft and the oil starts to separate.
                            Add black pepper powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and biryani masala powder. Mix well.
                            Add the partially cooked chicken to the masala. Cook until the chicken is tender and the masala coats the chicken pieces.
                            Layering Biryani:
                            Grease a heavy-bottomed pot. Layer half of the partially cooked rice at the bottom.
                            Place the cooked chicken masala over the rice layer.
                            Sprinkle fried onions (birista) and chopped coriander-mint leaves.
                            Layer the remaining rice on top.
                            Drizzle saffron-infused milk and ghee/butter on the rice. Garnish with more fried onions and chopped coriander-mint leaves.
                            Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.
                            Dum Cooking:
                            Cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and aromatic.
                            Serving:
                            Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the layers.

                        "Marinate the Fish:

                        In a bowl, combine the fish pieces with turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for about 30 minutes.
                        Prepare Masala Paste:
                        
                        Grind the grated coconut, chopped onion, tomatoes, green chilies, tamarind paste, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, dry red chilies, garlic, and ginger into a smooth paste. Add a little water if needed.
                        Cook the Masala:
                        
                        Heat oil in a pan. Add the ground masala paste, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder.
                        Cook the masala on medium heat, stirring constantly, until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.
                        Add Water:
                        
                        Add water to achieve the desired consistency for the curry. Bring it to a boil.
                        Add Fish:
                        
                        Gently add the marinated fish pieces to the boiling curry. Be careful not to break the fish.
                        Simmer:
                        
                        Reduce the heat to low and let the curry simmer until the fish is cooked through. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.
                        Adjust Seasoning:
                        
                        Taste the curry and adjust salt and spice levels as needed. If it's too tangy, you can balance it with a bit of sugar.
                        Finish with Coriander:
                        
                        Add chopped fresh coriander leaves and simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes.
                        Serve Hot:

                            Trim the ends of the okra and slit them lengthwise. If the okra is too long, you can cut it into smaller pieces.
                            Sauté Okra:
                            
                            Heat oil in a pan. Add the okra and sauté on medium heat until it's partially cooked and starts to brown. Stir occasionally to avoid sticking. Once done, remove the okra from the pan and set it aside.
                            Temper Cumin Seeds:
                            
                            In the same pan, add cumin seeds. Let them splutter.
                            Cook Onion and Ginger-Garlic Paste:
                            
                            Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                            Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute until the raw aroma disappears.
                            Add Tomatoes and Spices:
                            
                            Add chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate.
                            Stir in turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.
                            Combine Okra with Masala:
                            
                            Add the sautéed okra back to the pan. Mix it with the masala, ensuring that the okra is well-coated.

                        "Prepare Sugar Syrup:
                        Boil Sugar Syrup:
                        
                        In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring it to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
                        Add saffron strands and cardamom powder to the syrup. Simmer for a few more minutes until it reaches a slightly sticky consistency.
                        Cool Sugar Syrup:
                        
                        Allow the sugar syrup to cool. It will thicken further as it cools.
                        Fry Bread Slices:
                        Fry the Bread:
                        Heat ghee or oil in a pan over medium heat.
                        Fry the bread slices until they are golden brown and crisp on both sides.
                        Remove excess oil by placing the fried bread slices on paper towels.
                        Prepare Rabri:
                        Boil Milk:
                        
                        In a separate pan, bring the milk to a boil. Stir continuously to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.
                        Thicken Milk:
                        
                        Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer, stirring occasionally.
                        Add sugar and cardamom powder. Continue simmering until the milk thickens to a rabri consistency.
                        Add Nuts:
                        
                        Add chopped nuts to the thickened milk. Stir well and turn off the heat.
                        Assemble Shahi Tukda:
                        Soak Bread in Sugar Syrup:
                        
                        Dip the fried bread slices into the cooled sugar syrup for a few seconds. Ensure both sides are well-coated but not too soggy.
                        Arrange in Serving Dish:
                        
                        Place the soaked bread slices in a serving dish in a single layer.
                        Top with Rabri:
                        
                        Pour the prepared rabri over the bread slices, ensuring they are well-covered.
                        Garnish:
                        
                        Garnish with additional chopped nuts and saffron strands if desired.
                        Serve:
                        
                        Serve Shahi Tukda warm or chilled.">

                        In a bowl, mix rose syrup, sugar, and water to make the rose syrup solution. Adjust the sugar quantity according to your taste. Chill the syrup in the refrigerator.
                        Prepare Falooda Base:
                        Cook falooda sev (vermicelli) according to the package instructions. Once cooked, rinse it with cold water and let it cool.

                    1 liter full-fat milk
                    1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
                    1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
                    A handful of chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews), for garnish
                    A pinch of saffron strands (optional)"
                        data-recipe=
                        "Boil the Milk:

                        In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat. Stir continuously to avoid the milk sticking to the bottom of the pan.
                        Simmer and Reduce:

                        Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Keep stirring occasionally to prevent the milk from forming a skin.
                        Collect Malai:

                        As the milk simmers, you will notice a layer of malai (cream) forming on the surface. Gently collect this malai and push it to the sides of the pan. Continue simmering and collecting the malai.
                        Add Sugar:

                        After the milk has reduced to about half, add sugar to it. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.
                        Continue Simmering:

                        Continue simmering and stirring until the rabri reaches a thick and creamy consistency. This process can take some time, and the volume of the milk will significantly reduce.
                        Add Cardamom and Saffron:

                        Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the rabri. Stir well to incorporate the flavors.
                        Garnish:

                        Once the rabri has thickened to your desired consistency, turn off the heat. Garnish with chopped nuts.
                        Serve:

                        Rabri can be served warm or chilled. If serving chilled, refrigerate it for a few hours before serving.
                        Optional Step (Layered Rabri):

                        For a traditional layered rabri, you can pour a layer of reduced milk into a serving dish, add a layer of sugar, nuts, and cardamom powder, and repeat the process until you achieve the desired layers.">
